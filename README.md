ðŸš€ Excited to share my machine learning projects completed during my internship at #CodeSoft! ðŸ’»

Movie Genre Prediction: Delved into the world of film data to predict movie genres using machine learning algorithms. Leveraging techniques like natural language processing and feature engineering, I developed a model capable of accurately classifying movies into their respective genres.

Customer Churn Prediction: Analyzed customer data to forecast churn and identify factors influencing customer retention. By building predictive models and collaborating with teams to refine retention strategies, I developed a robust solution to help businesses anticipate and mitigate customer churn effectively.

Spam SMS Detection: Implemented machine learning techniques to tackle the issue of spam messages. Through data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, I created a system capable of accurately detecting and filtering out spam SMS, enhancing user experience and security.

These projects not only honed my technical skills in machine learning and data analysis but also provided valuable insights into real-world applications of artificial intelligence. Grateful for the opportunity to contribute to impactful solutions at #CodeSoft!
